# Recipe Manager Project

I have decided to create a recipe manager which allows you to:
Manage recipes stored in a CSV file.
Add new recipes to the list by editing the CSV file.
Search for recipes based on keywords such as the name of the recipe.
Filter recipes based on ingredients and their quantities.
